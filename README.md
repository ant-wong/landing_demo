# Demo Landing Page [WORK IN PROGRESS]

A sample front end web application that contains a landing page and multiple routes such as About, Contact, Reviews. This is built with reusability in mind. I am looking to further my CSS/SASS, UI, Responsiveness and React skills with this project.

### To run application
- Navigate to server folder and run `nodemon index.js`. So there's review data coming in.
- Navigate to project folder and run `npm start`. Explore page.

## Technolgies used
- React
- CSS/SASS
- Reactstrap
- Node/Express
- Yelp Fusion API
- Google Maps API
